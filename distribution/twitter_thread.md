## Tweet 1/5

Been working on something for pricing researchers:

Weekly snapshots of how 500+ online brands price their products.

Structured. Versioned. MIT licensed.

Not a product feed. A behavioral dataset.

## Tweet 2/5

What's in each snapshot:
- Current listed price
- Original/comparison price
- Discount percentage
- Category context

Same schema every week. Historical comparability built in.

## Tweet 3/5

Use cases:
- Pricing analysis
- Discount benchmarking
- Market research
- Academic work on e-commerce pricing

## Tweet 4/5

What it's not:
- Real-time (weekly is the right cadence for behavior)
- Complete catalogs (consistent samples > exhaustive coverage)
- Behind authentication (public pricing only)

## Tweet 5/5

Repo with full docs:

Methodology and data:

First snapshot release coming soon.
