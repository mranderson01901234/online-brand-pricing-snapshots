## Title

Weekly Pricing Snapshots for 500+ Online Brands (Free, MIT Licensed)

---

## Body

I've been working on a dataset that captures weekly pricing behavior from online brand storefronts.

**What it is:**
- Weekly snapshots of pricing data from 500+ DTC and e-commerce brands
- Structured schema: current price, original price, discount percentage, category
- Historical comparability (same schema across all snapshots)
- MIT licensed

**What it's for:**
- Pricing analysis and benchmarking
- Market research on e-commerce behavior
- Academic research on retail pricing dynamics
- Building models that need consistent pricing signals

**What it's not:**
- A product catalog (it's behavioral data, not inventory)
- Real-time (weekly cadence, not live feeds)
- Complete (consistent sample > exhaustive coverage)

The repo has full documentation on methodology, schema, and limitations. First data release is coming soon.
