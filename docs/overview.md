# Overview

## Why this dataset exists

Online pricing is one of the most dynamic and least documented aspects of modern retail. Prices change constantly, discounts come and go, and the historical record is effectively nonexistent unless someone captures it.

This dataset exists to fill that gap.

By publishing weekly snapshots of online brand pricing behavior, we create a structured, comparable record that supports real analysis—not just observation.

## Who this is for

**Pricing analysts** who need to benchmark behavior across brands without building their own collection infrastructure.

**Market researchers** studying how online retail responds to seasons, competition, and economic shifts.

**Academics** investigating e-commerce pricing dynamics, discount strategies, or consumer-facing price presentation.

**Builders** creating tools, dashboards, or models that depend on consistent pricing signals.

## What questions this dataset answers well

- How do discount rates vary across brands and categories?
- How has a brand's pricing behavior changed over time?
- When do brands run promotions, and how deep are the discounts?
- What's the typical spread between original and sale prices?
- How consistent is pricing behavior week over week?

## What this dataset is not good for

This is not a product catalog. It does not track inventory, availability, or product attributes beyond what's needed for pricing context.

It does not capture real-time pricing. If you need sub-daily granularity, this isn't the right source.

It does not include private or authenticated pricing. Member pricing, loyalty discounts, and regional variations are outside scope unless explicitly documented.

If you need exhaustive coverage of every SKU a brand sells, this dataset will disappoint you. It captures behavior, not completeness.

## Coverage

The scope of brands and categories is documented in snapshot release notes. Coverage evolves as the project matures—brands may be added or removed based on data quality and relevance.

Historical snapshots are never modified. What's published stays published.
