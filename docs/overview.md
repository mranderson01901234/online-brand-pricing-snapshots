# Overview

## What this dataset represents

Online Brand Pricing Snapshots is a collection of point-in-time pricing data captured from publicly accessible online storefronts. Each snapshot records product prices, discount indicators, and related metadata as observed at the time of collection.

The dataset focuses on observable pricing behavior rather than internal pricing strategies or non-public promotional mechanisms.

## Who typically uses this data

- **Market researchers** analyzing pricing trends across online retail
- **Pricing analysts** benchmarking against competitor behavior
- **Academics** studying e-commerce pricing dynamics
- **Data journalists** investigating retail pricing patterns

## Why snapshots exist

Pricing in online retail is dynamic. Products may be discounted, repriced, or removed from listings frequently. Point-in-time snapshots preserve this information for historical analysis.

Without snapshots, pricing changes are lost. This dataset provides a record of pricing states that can be compared over time.

## Coverage

Coverage details will be documented alongside published snapshots. The scope of brands and product categories may change as the project evolves.
