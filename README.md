# Online Brand Pricing Snapshots

## What this is

This repository contains weekly snapshots of publicly available pricing data from online brands. Each snapshot captures product pricing and discount behavior at a specific point in time, enabling analysis of pricing patterns across the online retail landscape.

## What's included

- **Weekly snapshots** — Point-in-time captures of pricing data (snapshots will be published as the project progresses)
- **Documentation** — Methodology, schema definitions, and usage guidance in the `/docs` folder
- **Methodology summary** — Overview of collection and normalization processes

## Intended use

- Market research
- Pricing analysis
- Discount benchmarking
- Trend observation

## Methodology

Data is collected from publicly accessible storefronts using standardized collection methods. Prices are normalized to a common format and verified against source data before inclusion.

For a detailed overview, see [docs/methodology-summary.md](docs/methodology-summary.md).

## Limitations

- Data represents aggregated public storefront pricing only
- Coverage is limited to brands included in the collection scope
- Historical coverage may vary as sources are added or removed
- Promotional pricing may not capture all discount mechanisms
- Data reflects what is publicly visible and may not include member-only or regional pricing
